# üåå Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Celestial Object Classification

This project leverages astronomical data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** to classify celestial objects into three categories: **STAR**, **GALAXY**, or **QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object / Quasar)**. Using data from **Data Release 18 (DR18)**, this project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze over **100,000** labeled observations from across the universe.

## üöÄ Project Objective

Our goal is to build a robust classifier that predicts the type of each observed celestial object based on its photometric and spectral properties.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) - Data Release 18
- **Observations**: 100,000
- **Features**: Photometric and spectral measurements such as:
  - `u`, `g`, `r`, `i`, `z` magnitudes (five-band photometry)
  - Color indices and spectral line measurements
  - Redshift
- **STAR**: Self-luminous astronomical bodies like our Sun.
- **GALAXY**: Massive systems of stars, stellar remnants, gas, and dust.
- **QSO (Quasar)**: Extremely bright active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes.
